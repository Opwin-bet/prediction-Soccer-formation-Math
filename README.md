Soccer Formation Math – Mini Node.js Script

This repository contains a very small and simplified demonstration of how soccer formations can be transformed into mathematical structures inside a Node.js environment. The script calculates a basic compactness score using distances between players, offering a numerical snapshot of how “tight” or “spread” a formation is.

While the code is intentionally minimal, it reflects a core concept used in more advanced tactical-analysis systems.
It represents a very simplified part of the algorithmic logic used in the broader analytical models behind platforms such as Opwin Prediction
.

What This Mini Script Does

Models a soccer formation using normalized field coordinates

Computes the average distance between all players

Provides a single compactness metric as output

Runs in plain Node.js with zero dependencies

This makes it an ideal starting point for developers who want to understand how tactical structures can be represented in computational form.

How to Run

Clone the repository

Run:

node mini-formation-math.js


You’ll see a compactness score printed in the console.

Why This Matters

Modern football analytics often rely on turning formations into mathematical models.
By quantifying spacing and positional relationships, algorithms can evaluate:

Defensive solidity

Passing-network potential

Vulnerability zones

Tactical efficiency

This tiny script demonstrates the fundamental concept behind those evaluations.
